Inventory Management System
Overview
The Inventory Management System is a software project designed to simplify the tracking and management of products, suppliers, and sales in a warehouse or store environment. This project utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure a modular, scalable, and maintainable solution.
Features
‚Ä¢	Product Management: Add, delete, and update product information.
‚Ä¢	Supplier Management: Track suppliers and manage supplier details.
‚Ä¢	Stock Management: Monitor stock levels, update inventory after sales, and handle low-stock alerts.
‚Ä¢	Sales Management: Record and track sales transactions.
‚Ä¢	Modular Design: System components are divided into distinct modules, making them easily manageable and reusable.
Technologies Used
‚Ä¢	Programming Language: Python
‚Ä¢	Object-Oriented Programming Principles:
o	Encapsulation
o	Inheritance
o	Abstraction
o	Polymorphism
Project Structure
The project follows a modular structure where each component is handled separately:
bash

‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Product.py              # Base class for products and specialized product categories
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Supplier.py             # Manages supplier details and products supplied
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Stock.py                # Handles inventory operations

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                 # Script to demonstrate the system's functionality
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md               # Project documentation
Installation
To run the project, ensure you have Python installed. Follow these steps:
1.	Clone the repository:
bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/inventory-management-system.git
2.	Navigate to the project directory:
bash

cd inventory-management-system
3.	Run the main.py file:
bash

python main.py
Usage
1.	The system will initialize with an empty inventory.
2.	Suppliers can be added to the system.
3.	Products (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Grocery) can be added to the inventory.
4.	The stock of products can be updated, and sales can be recorded.
5.	The system will display current stock levels and maintain a sales history.
Example
python

from Inventory import Inventory
from Product import Electronics, Clothing, Grocery
from Supplier import Supplier

# Set up inventory system
inventory = Inventory()

# Create suppliers
supplier1 = Supplier("ABC Electronics", "123-456-7890")
inventory.add_supplier(supplier1)

# Add products to inventory
tv = Electronics("TV", 400, 10, warranty=2)
inventory.add_product_to_inventory(tv)

# Record a sale
inventory.record_sale("TV", 2)

# Display stock and sales history
inventory.display_stock()
inventory.display_sales_history()
OOP Principles Implemented
‚Ä¢	Encapsulation: Private attributes to protect data integrity.
‚Ä¢	Inheritance: Specialized product categories (Electronics, Clothing, Grocery) inherit from a base Product class.
‚Ä¢	Abstraction: Generalized behaviors are defined in the base Product class and overridden in subclasses.
‚Ä¢	Polymorphism: Shared operations (e.g., updating stock) are handled using overridden methods in subclasses.
Future Enhancements
‚Ä¢	Implement detailed reporting for inventory and sales.
‚Ä¢	Integrate a database for persistent data storage.
‚Ä¢	Add user authentication and access control for different roles (e.g., admin, manager).
‚Ä¢	Develop a web interface for better accessibility and user experience.
